# MIDAS Task 3(NLP)
A natural language processsing model written in python using jupytor notebook.

## Problem
The problem was identified as text classification task in NLP in which product categorisation is being done based on the description of product. The dataset is taken from an e-commerce website flipkart and the link to the dataset can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pLv0fNE4WHokpJHUIs-FTVnmI9STgog05e658qEON0I/edit?usp=sharing ). 
The data is split into training and test sets to first train the ML models and then test its accuracy. LogLoss function is used as a metric for accuracy.

## Approach
I approached the model in following in the follwing way:
-Data Pre-processing
-Fitting the model

### Data Pre-processing
The data preprocessing is started off by cleaning the data
